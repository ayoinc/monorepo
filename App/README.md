### Step 1: Create the Web Application

#### 1.1 Application Code:
Create a simple "Hello World" web application in the nodejs. For this example, let's assume you're using Node.js:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/App
cd ~/App
```

```javascript
// ~/App/app.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 80;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

```bash
echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
npm init -y
npm install express
```

#### 1.2 Test Locally:
Run your application locally to ensure it's working as expected:

```bash
node app.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:80` in your browser to see the "Hello World!" message.

### Step 2: Containerize the Application with Docker

#### 2.1 Dockerfile:
Create a `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image for your application:

```Dockerfile
# ~/App/Dockerfile
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

#### 2.2 Build Docker Image:
Build the Docker image and run it locally to ensure it's working as expected:

```bash
docker build -t app:latest .
docker run -p 80:80 app:latest
```

Visit `http://localhost:80` in your browser to ensure the application is still working as expected.

### Step 3: Write Terraform Configuration for Infrastructure

Create the necessary directories and files:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/terraform/{modules/{ecs,networking,security,ecr,docker-push},prod}
touch ~/terraform/modules/{ecs,networking,security,ecr,docker-push}/main.tf
touch ~/terraform/prod/{main.tf,variables.tf,output.tf}
```

#### 3.1 Networking Module:
Define your VPC, subnets, and internet gateway within a networking module.

#### 3.2 Security Module:
Define your security groups within a security module.

#### 3.3 ECR Repository Module:
Define an ECR repository to store your Docker image.

#### 3.4 ECS Module:
Define your ECS cluster, task definition, and service.

#### 3.5 Docker Push Module:
Create a module to build your Docker image locally, tag it, and push it to your ECR repository.

### Step 4: Deploy Infrastructure and Application

Navigate to the `terraform/prod` directory, initialize your Terraform configuration, and apply it to deploy your infrastructure and application to AWS:

```bash
cd ~/terraform/prod
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

Verify the deployment by accessing the web application through the URL of the load balancer provided in the output of the `terraform apply` command.

### Step 6: Documentation

Create a `README.md` file explaining the precise steps required to deploy and destroy the solution, including any software prerequisites, the deployment process, and how to verify the deployment.

### Step 7: Maintenance, Scaling, and Improvement

Consider monitoring, logging, and setting up a CI/CD pipeline for easier management of new releases, as well as performance tuning and security enhancements.

### Step 8: Tearing Down

If needed, destroy the deployed infrastructure using the following command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

### Step 9: Handover

Ensure that your documentation is well-organized to facilitate a smooth handover to other team members or stakeholders.

This structured approach ensures that your application is functioning correctly at each stage before moving on to the next, from local development, to containerization, to deployment on AWS.
